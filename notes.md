MCP 101: Building the Next Generation of Context-Aware AI AgentsPart 1: The Dawn of Agentic AI and Its Fundamental ChallengeThe Tipping Point: From Text Generation to Real-World ActionThe field of artificial intelligence is undergoing a profound transformation, moving beyond the generation of text and images into a new era of practical, real-world action. Recent advancements demonstrate that AI is on the cusp of becoming not just a tool for productivity, but a partner in discovery and execution. This shift is best exemplified by the emergence of "agentic AI"—autonomous systems that can reason, plan, and use tools to accomplish complex goals with minimal human intervention.1A landmark demonstration of this capability was presented at the Microsoft Build 2025 keynote, where an AI agent system, Microsoft Discovery, was tasked with a challenge of immense scientific and commercial importance: discovering a new, sustainable material for immersion cooling in data centers.4 The objective was to find an alternative to "forever chemicals," a task that would traditionally require months, or even years, of painstaking laboratory trial and error. The AI agent system compressed this discovery process into a matter of days.4Crucially, this was not a mere simulation. The system analyzed vast datasets of chemical properties, formulated hypotheses, and identified a shortlist of promising molecular candidates. Microsoft's team then synthesized one of these AI-identified materials. The keynote featured a video from the lab showing a standard PC, running the graphically demanding game Forza Motorsport, fully submerged in the novel coolant. The AI-discovered liquid successfully maintained a stable temperature without the use of any fans, validating the agent's findings in the physical world.4This achievement is emblematic of a broader trend. AI agents are now capable of executing sophisticated, multi-step workflows that were recently the exclusive domain of human experts. For instance, autonomous agents can conduct comprehensive competitive analyses, a task that involves identifying competitors through market research, gathering data from websites and news articles, analyzing strengths and weaknesses, and generating a formatted, 15-page report complete with data visualizations and strategic recommendations—a process that can take a human 6-8 hours, completed by an agent in under 50 minutes.5 Other systems, like HeyGen's Video Agent, can take a single prompt and autonomously build a narrative, generate a synthetic voice, and edit a complete video, showcasing agency in creative domains.6This evolution from generative AI to agentic AI marks a fundamental paradigm shift. The initial wave of modern AI focused on passive content creation; the new frontier is active problem-solving.2 The value proposition is expanding from enhancing personal productivity, such as writing an email faster, to augmenting strategic capabilities, like accelerating scientific discovery or automating complex business intelligence.2 For enterprises, this signals a move toward exponential returns on investment, driven by operational optimization, enhanced customer engagement, and groundbreaking innovation.2The Context Gap: Why Isolated LLMs Are Not EnoughDespite the immense potential of agentic AI, a fundamental obstacle has historically hindered its widespread adoption: the context gap. Large Language Models (LLMs), the engines that power these agents, are incredibly powerful but exist in a state of isolation. They are, as some have described, "incredibly smart in a vacuum," but are cut off from the real-time, proprietary, and dynamic information necessary to perform truly useful tasks in the real world.8This gap manifests in several critical ways:The Knowledge Cutoff: An LLM's knowledge is frozen at the end of its training period. It is entirely unaware of events, news, software updates, or API changes that have occurred since that date.10 This makes it unreliable for any task requiring current information.The Data Silo Problem: The most valuable data for any organization or individual—customer information in a CRM, financial data in a database, project plans in cloud storage, or personal files on a local machine—is completely inaccessible to a standard LLM.11 This isolation is a primary cause of failure for AI initiatives; studies indicate that over 80% of AI projects falter due to issues with poor data quality and a lack of access to relevant, timely data.11 The problem is so pervasive that over half of executives in the banking sector, for example, report lacking a unified view of their customers because of these data silos, crippling any attempt to deploy effective AI.11The "N×M Integration Problem": Before the advent of a universal standard, connecting AI systems to external tools was a Sisyphean task. To connect N different AI models to M different tools and data sources, developers were forced to build N multiplied by M bespoke, brittle integrations.12 Each LLM provider, from OpenAI to Google, had its own proprietary method for "function-calling" or tool use, creating a fragmented and unscalable ecosystem.13 This integration overhead was not merely an inconvenience; it was a strategic barrier that made building, maintaining, and scaling agentic AI prohibitively expensive and complex.14The context gap is the principal reason why the transformative power of agentic AI has remained, for many, just out of reach. It created a reality where the conversation shifted from simple "prompt engineering" to a much more complex challenge of "context engineering"—the practice of manually stitching together the necessary data and tools to make an LLM useful.1 To unlock the next generation of AI, the industry required a foundational solution to this integration crisis.AspectTraditional (N×M) ApproachMCP Standardized ApproachIntegration EffortHigh: Custom code for each model-tool pair.Low: Build one MCP server, use with any MCP client.DiscoverabilityManual: Developers must read API documentation.Automated: Runtime reflection via MCP protocol.InteroperabilityLow: Integrations are vendor-locked and model-specific.High: Model-agnostic open standard promotes ecosystem-wide use.SecurityAd-hoc: API keys often hardcoded or managed inconsistently.Standardized: Uses OAuth 2.1, scopes, and user consent flows.MaintainabilityBrittle: A change in an external API breaks the client integration.Resilient: Protocol versioning and separation of concerns absorb changes.ScalabilityPoor: Complexity grows exponentially (N×M).Excellent: Complexity grows linearly (N+M).Table 1: The Integration Dilemma: MCP vs. Traditional API Integration. This table summarizes the fundamental shift from a fragmented, high-friction integration landscape to a standardized, low-friction ecosystem enabled by MCP. Sources:.1Part 2: The Solution: The Model Context Protocol (MCP)A Universal Standard for AI IntegrationIn response to the critical challenge of the context gap, the industry has rapidly converged on a powerful solution: the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Introduced by Anthropic in November 2024 and subsequently open-sourced, MCP is a protocol that standardizes how AI models and agents connect to external tools, data, and services.12 It provides a common language for AI integration, effectively creating a universal adapter that bridges the gap between the isolated intelligence of LLMs and the dynamic data of the real world.To make this concept tangible, two key analogies are frequently used:"USB-C for AI": This is the most potent and widely adopted analogy.18 Just as USB-C provides a standardized physical port and electrical protocol that allows any compliant device to connect to any compliant peripheral, MCP provides a standardized software protocol for AI "peripherals." A developer can build an MCP server for their database or API once, and any MCP-compliant AI application can then "plug into" it seamlessly, regardless of the underlying LLM.14"Language Server Protocol (LSP) for AI": This analogy resonates deeply with developers.12 LSP, a protocol developed by Microsoft, decoupled programming language intelligence (like autocompletion, linting, and go-to-definition) from code editors. Before LSP, to add Python support to a new editor, one had to build a whole new Python analysis engine. After LSP, a single Python LSP server can provide intelligence to any editor that speaks the protocol, such as VS Code, Zed, or Neovim. MCP does for AI tools what LSP did for language features.22 A single MCP server for the GitHub API can be used by any MCP-compatible client, whether it's the Claude Desktop app, the Cursor IDE, or a custom-built agent.21The power and rapid success of MCP stem directly from its nature as an open, model-agnostic standard. Unlike proprietary plugin ecosystems that create vendor lock-in, MCP fosters a "rising tide lifts all boats" dynamic.21 This created powerful network effects: tool developers like Slack and GitHub only need to build one MCP server to gain access to the entire ecosystem of major AI models. Conversely, AI platform providers like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic only need to implement one MCP client in their products to give their users access to a vast and rapidly growing library of tools.1 This collaborative, open approach is why MCP has quickly become the de facto industry standard for the agentic AI era.8 For developers, this means that building on MCP is a future-proof decision; an MCP server built today is designed to work with the AI clients of tomorrow.The MCP Architecture: Hosts, Clients, and ServersThe Model Context Protocol is built on a clear and logical client-server architecture. Understanding these three core components is fundamental to grasping how MCP works.17MCP Host: This is the primary application that the end-user interacts with. It can be a desktop application like the Claude app or the Cursor IDE, a web-based chatbot interface, or any other AI-powered tool.18 The Host is responsible for managing the overall user experience, aggregating context from various sources, and orchestrating the AI model's interactions.1MCP Client: This is an intermediary component that lives inside the MCP Host. A Host can run multiple MCP Clients simultaneously. Each Client is responsible for managing a dedicated, one-to-one connection with a single MCP Server.9 This one-to-one relationship is a key design choice that ensures connections are isolated and stateful.24MCP Server: This is a lightweight application that exposes a specific capability or data source through the standardized MCP protocol. For example, one MCP server might wrap the GitHub API, another might provide access to a local filesystem, and a third could connect to a PostgreSQL database.17 Servers are designed to be simple and focused, handling a specific domain of responsibility. They can be run locally on the user's machine (e.g., for file access) or remotely as a cloud service.15This architecture is designed for security and separation of concerns. The Host and its Clients manage the full conversation history and user interaction, while each Server only receives the specific information it needs to perform its task, preventing servers from seeing the entire context or the operations of other servers.24Communication between these components is handled via the JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol, a simple and lightweight remote procedure call protocol.12 There are four primary message types used in MCP:Requests: Sent from a Client to a Server (or vice versa in advanced cases like sampling) to ask for information or to invoke a tool.Results: Sent from a Server back to a Client in response to a successful request.Errors: Sent in response to a request that could not be fulfilled.Notifications: One-way messages that do not require a response, used for things like progress updates or logging.17Our Agenda: Building an AI Research AssistantTo make these concepts concrete, this report will walk through the process of building a coherent project from the ground up: an AI Research Assistant. This agentic application will be designed to help a researcher find, analyze, and manage academic papers, demonstrating how MCP enables the creation of powerful, context-aware tools.The construction of this assistant will serve as the narrative thread for the remainder of this report, providing a practical demonstration of MCP's features in a logical progression. The build-up plan is as follows:Scaffold the Server: We will begin by creating a basic ArXiv MCP server, giving our agent the ability to search for academic papers.Add Capabilities: We will then differentiate between MCP's core primitives by adding Tools to download papers and Resources to read their abstracts.Improve UX: To handle long-running tasks gracefully, we will implement progress Notifications and structured logging.Add Secure State: We will introduce a second MCP server for Zotero, a reference management tool. This will require our agent to handle Authentication to access the user's private library.Explore Advanced Features: Finally, we will touch upon advanced interactive patterns like Elicitation, Roots, and Sampling to make the agent more intelligent, secure, and dynamic.This step-by-step project will provide a grounded, practical understanding of how to leverage MCP to build the next generation of AI agents.Part 3: A Grounded Example: Building the AI Research AssistantScaffolding the ArXiv MCP ServerThe first step in building our AI Research Assistant is to give it a foundational capability: the ability to search for academic papers. We will accomplish this by creating a simple MCP server that interfaces with the ArXiv API. A key design principle of MCP is that servers should be extremely easy to build, allowing developers to focus on their specific domain logic rather than protocol boilerplate.24 Modern MCP frameworks and SDKs make this process remarkably straightforward.The process can be broken down into four simple steps:Environment Setup: The first step is to prepare a development environment. Using a modern package manager like uv is recommended for its speed and simplicity.25 A new project directory is created, and a Python virtual environment is initialized to manage dependencies in an isolated manner. The necessary libraries—the MCP Python SDK and the arxiv library for accessing the API—are then installed.uv init arxiv-assistantuv venvsource.venv/bin/activateuv add "mcp[cli]" arxivServer Initialization: With the environment ready, the server itself can be initialized with just a single line of code using a high-level framework like FastMCP, which is part of the official Python SDK.26 This handles all the underlying protocol negotiation and connection management.mcp = FastMCP("ArXiv Research Server", port=8002)Defining a Tool: The core logic of the server is encapsulated in standard Python functions. To expose a function to the MCP ecosystem, the developer simply adds a decorator. The @mcp.tool() decorator tells the FastMCP framework to register the search_papers function as an MCP Tool, making it discoverable and callable by any connected MCP client. The framework automatically introspects the function's signature and docstring to generate the necessary schema for the LLM.26Running and Testing the Server: The server can be run with a simple command. Once active, it can be tested immediately using a tool like the MCP Inspector, an interactive debugging utility that allows developers to connect to their server, inspect its capabilities, and make test calls without needing a full client application.19uv run python server.pyIn another terminal: uv run mcp dev server.pyThe following pseudo-code illustrates the complete, minimal implementation of our initial ArXiv server.Python# server.py

Pseudo-code for a basic ArXiv MCP server. Sources:.25With just this small amount of code, we have created a functional, standardized interface to ArXiv that any MCP-compatible AI agent can now use.Differentiating Actions and Data: Tools vs. ResourcesWith a basic server running, we can now expand its capabilities. MCP provides three core primitives for exposing functionality: Tools, Resources, and Prompts. Understanding the distinction between them is critical, as this separation of concerns is a core design principle of the protocol, enabling more predictable, secure, and auditable agent behavior.1Tools: A Tool represents an executable function that performs an action and may produce a side effect.19 This is analogous to a POST or PUT request in a traditional REST API. Tools are for doing things: downloading a file, saving data to a database, sending an email, or running a calculation. In our project, search_papers is a tool. We will now add a new tool, download_paper(paper_id), which will fetch a PDF and save it to a local directory. The LLM understands that invoking a tool will cause a change in the environment.9Resources: A Resource represents read-only, file-like data that is used to provide context to the LLM.19 This is analogous to a GET request. Resources are for looking things up: reading the content of a file, fetching a user's profile from an API, or retrieving a document from a database. They are identified by a URI-like string. We will add a resource, resource://arxiv/{paper_id}/abstract, which will return the abstract of a specific paper. The LLM uses resources to gather information before deciding which tool to use, if any.9Prompts: A Prompt is a reusable, server-defined template for a common workflow or interaction pattern.19 They bundle together instructions, context from resources, and potential tool calls to guide the user or LLM through a specific task. For our project, we could define a prompt called "Deep Paper Analysis" that instructs the agent to first fetch a paper's abstract, then search for related papers, and finally synthesize a summary. This allows a server developer to encapsulate best practices for using their server's capabilities into a single, user-callable action.32This explicit separation allows an AI agent to reason more effectively about its available capabilities. It can distinguish between "actions I can take" (Tools), "information I can retrieve" (Resources), and "workflows I can execute" (Prompts). This structure is also vital for security, as a client application can apply more stringent user approval requirements for tools that modify state versus resources that only read data.PrimitiveDescriptionAnalogyExample in AI Research AssistantToolAn executable function that can perform an action and cause a side effect.POST Requestdownload_paper(paper_id)ResourceRead-only, file-like data used to provide context to the LLM.GET Requestresource://arxiv/{paper_id}/abstractPromptA reusable, server-defined template for a common workflow.Workflow Template"Analyze this paper for me."Table 2: Core MCP Primitives. This table clarifies the distinct roles of the three main capabilities an MCP server can expose. Sources:.9Part 4: Advanced MCP Capabilities in ActionEnhancing User Experience: Progress Notifications and LoggingA common challenge in agentic workflows is handling long-running operations. If an agent invokes a tool that takes several minutes to complete, such as downloading a large file or running a complex data analysis, the user is left waiting without any feedback. This creates a poor user experience. MCP addresses this directly through a built-in notification system for progress tracking.33To implement this in our AI Research Assistant, we can enhance the download_paper tool. Instead of downloading a single paper, let's imagine a version that downloads an entire collection of papers based on a search query. This operation could take a significant amount of time.The progress tracking flow is simple and elegant:Client Request: When the client (the AI agent's host application) calls the download_paper_collection tool, it includes a unique progressToken in the request's metadata. This token acts as an identifier for this specific operation.34JSON{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "req-001",
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "download_paper_collection",
    "arguments": { "query": "transformer models" },
    "_meta": { "progressToken": "download-xyz-789" }
  }
}
Server Notifications: As the server iterates through the list of papers to download, it periodically sends notifications/progress messages back to the client. These are one-way messages that require no response. Each notification includes the original progressToken, the current progress value, the total value, and an optional human-readable message.33JSON{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "notifications/progress",
  "params": {
    "progressToken": "download-xyz-789",
    "progress": 5,
    "total": 20,
    "message": "Downloading paper 5 of 20..."
  }
}
The client application can then use these notifications to render a progress bar or display status updates in the UI, keeping the user informed.33This same notification mechanism is also used for structured logging. A server can send notifications/message payloads with different log levels (e.g., debug, info, warning, error) and a structured data object. This allows a server developer to send detailed operational telemetry to the client's log console, which is invaluable for debugging without cluttering the main tool response.33 This provides essential observability into the server's behavior, a critical component for managing production systems.36Securing the Agent: Authentication with OAuth 2.1So far, our Research Assistant has only interacted with public data from ArXiv. A truly useful assistant, however, must be able to interact with a user's private data and services. To demonstrate this, we will introduce a new requirement: the agent must be able to save papers from its ArXiv search into the user's personal Zotero library, a popular open-source reference management tool.12This introduces the need for authentication and authorization. The agent cannot be allowed to access or modify a user's private Zotero library without explicit permission. MCP provides a standardized, secure, and user-friendly solution for this by building on the industry-standard OAuth 2.1 protocol.15We will now add a second MCP server to our ecosystem: a Zotero server. A rich community of open-source Zotero MCP servers already exists, providing tools like add_paper_to_collection and list_collections.37 Our agent can now orchestrate a workflow between the two servers: find a paper using the ArXiv server, then save it using the Zotero server.The authentication flow proceeds as follows:The agent attempts to call the Zotero server's add_paper_to_collection tool.Because the request lacks an authentication token, the Zotero MCP server responds with a 401 Unauthorized error.40The MCP client in the host application catches this error and initiates the OAuth 2.1 flow. It first discovers the necessary authorization endpoints by fetching a standard metadata document from the server (e.g., at /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server).40The client opens the user's browser and redirects them to the Zotero authorization URL, requesting specific permissions (scopes), such as library:write.The user logs into their Zotero account (if not already logged in) and sees a consent screen clearly stating what access the "AI Research Assistant" is requesting.Upon user approval, the browser redirects back to the MCP client with a temporary authorization code.The client securely exchanges this code for a long-lived access token and a refresh token. This exchange is protected by the Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) mechanism, which prevents authorization code interception attacks.40The client retries the original add_paper_to_collection tool call, this time including the access token in the Authorization: Bearer <token> header. The Zotero server validates the token and executes the request.40A crucial innovation in MCP's approach to authentication is its design for "plug-and-play" connectivity. The traditional OAuth flow often requires a developer to manually visit each service's developer portal, register their application, and copy-paste a client_id and client_secret. This would reintroduce the N×M problem for authentication, creating massive friction. MCP elegantly sidesteps this by mandating support for Dynamic Client Registration (RFC 7591).15 This extension to OAuth allows an MCP client application (like Claude Desktop) to programmatically register itself with a new MCP server's authorization provider the very first time a user attempts to connect.This is a profound improvement for user experience. The user simply clicks "Connect to Zotero," logs in, and grants consent. The complex dance of client registration, endpoint discovery, and token exchange is handled entirely by the protocol. This makes the most secure path the easiest one, which is essential for driving adoption and ensuring safety across a diverse and growing ecosystem of tools.15A Fly-Over of Advanced Interactive PatternsBeyond notifications and authentication, MCP specifies several other advanced capabilities that enable more sophisticated and intelligent agentic behavior. Here is a brief overview of three key patterns, contextualized within our AI Research Assistant project.Elicitation: This powerful feature allows a server to request additional information from the user at runtime.43 Instead of having an LLM guess or make an assumption when faced with ambiguity, the server can pause its execution and send an elicitation/create request back to the client.Example: A user asks our agent, "Find papers on 'transformers'." The term is ambiguous. The ArXiv server, instead of defaulting to one interpretation, can use elicitation to ask for clarification. It sends a request with a schema defining the expected input.JSON{
  "method": "elicitation/create",
  "params": {
    "message": "Which type of 'transformers' are you interested in?",
    "requestedSchema": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "topic": {
          "type": "string",
          "enum": ["ai_models", "electrical_engineering"],
          "enumNames":
        }
      },
      "required": ["topic"]
    }
  }
}
The MCP client (e.g., VS Code, Claude Desktop) renders this as a native UI element, like a dropdown menu or a quick pick dialog.45 The user's structured response is sent back to the server, which can then proceed with the correct information. Elicitation is the key to creating truly interactive, human-in-the-loop workflows where the agent can gracefully handle ambiguity.43Roots: This is a security and scoping mechanism that allows a client to define the filesystem boundaries within which a server is permitted to operate.47 When a server's capabilities involve local file access, this is a critical safeguard.Example: When our agent uses the download_paper tool, the client application (running on the user's machine) will have a pre-configured "root," such as file:///Users/researcher/AI_Papers_Project/. The client communicates this root to the server during initialization. A well-behaved server will then validate any file paths against this root, refusing to read from or write to any location outside this designated directory tree.48Roots are essential for preventing a malicious or simply confused agent from accessing sensitive system files or overwriting important data on the user's computer.47Sampling: This feature allows a server to request a completion from the client's LLM.50 This inverts the typical flow of control, enabling a tool or data source to leverage the powerful reasoning capabilities of the host's AI model.Example: After our agent uses the get_paper_abstract resource to fetch an abstract, the ArXiv server itself could initiate a sampling/createMessage request. The request would contain the abstract text and a prompt like, "Please summarize this abstract for a non-expert audience in one sentence." The MCP client would pass this to its LLM, get the summary, and return the result to the server.19This allows server developers to build intelligence into their tools without needing to manage their own LLM API keys or model deployments. It keeps the core intelligence centralized within the client application, while allowing servers to request AI-powered transformations or analyses of their own data.51Part 5: The MCP Ecosystem and Your Next StepsThe Expanding Universe of MCPThe true power of a protocol like MCP lies in its network effects. Because it is an open standard, a vibrant and rapidly expanding ecosystem of servers has emerged, built by a global community of developers and companies.21 The AI Research Assistant we've conceptualized is just one example. By building to the MCP standard, developers unlock access to a vast and growing library of pre-built integrations, dramatically accelerating the development of capable, multi-tool agents.An agent built today can seamlessly orchestrate tools across numerous domains, from developer productivity and database management to communication and enterprise software. This composability is the ultimate promise of MCP: developers are no longer building siloed integrations but are contributing to and drawing from a shared, interoperable toolkit for AI.CategoryExample ServersFunctionalityDeveloper ToolsGitHub, GitLab, Docker, Playwright, VSCode DevtoolsCode management, CI/CD, container orchestration, browser automation, IDE integration.DatabasesPostgreSQL, SingleStore, Vectorize, Redis, Apache DorisQuerying structured data, managing vector embeddings, key-value storage.CommunicationSlack, Gmail, Microsoft TeamsSending messages, reading channels, managing emails and calendar events.ProductivityGoogle Drive, Notion, Zotero, Microsoft 365File access, document editing, reference management, enterprise data access.Web SearchBrave Search, DuckDuckGo Search, TavilyPerforming real-time, privacy-focused web searches to augment LLM knowledge.AggregatorsZapier, Pipedream, n8nConnecting to thousands of other SaaS applications through a single MCP server.Table 3: A Glimpse into the MCP Server Ecosystem.

This table provides a curated list of essential resources for developers looking to start building with MCP.Conclusion: The Future is ComposableThe Model Context Protocol represents a pivotal moment in the evolution of artificial intelligence. It is the foundational layer—the standardized "glue"—that resolves the critical context gap, finally connecting the powerful reasoning of LLMs to the world of real-time data and functional tools.1 By abstracting away the immense complexity of N×M integration, MCP liberates developers from the tedious and brittle work of building custom bridges.62This shift enables a new paradigm of AI development centered on composability. Developers can now focus their efforts on what truly matters: designing intelligent agentic workflows that orchestrate a rich ecosystem of interoperable, secure, and discoverable tools. The future of AI is not monolithic; it is a dynamic network of specialized services and agents working in concert. MCP provides the universal language that makes this collaborative future possible. The call to action for every developer is clear: identify a tool or data source used every day, build a simple MCP server for it, and contribute to unlocking its potential for the entire AI ecosystem. The time to start building is now.
